# Portfolio-Landing-Space


##This is a portfolio landing page for my current/future projects. The purpose of this website is to show people the my current skill level in web design using HTML and CSS. This landing page will improve with time as I learn more efficiently ways to code and lay-out webpages. The outline of what I have going for this is as my portfolio will continue to grow and improve.

##The purpose of the website is to display all the projects I have ever worked on and to give you a little bio about myself.
